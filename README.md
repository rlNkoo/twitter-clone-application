## Overview

Welcome to the Twitter Clone, a full-stack web application that replicates the core functionalities of Twitter. This project serves as a showcase of modern web development techniques, integrating powerful backend technologies with a dynamic and responsive front-end.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user login, registration, and session management using Spring Security 3 and JWT tokens.

## Technologies Used

### Back-End
- **Spring Boot:** A robust and scalable framework for building the application's backend. It simplifies dependency management, provides embedded servers, and promotes a convention-over-configuration approach.
- **Spring Security 3 & JWT:** Provides strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) ensures secure token-based user sessions.
- **MySQL Database:** Efficiently manages and stores application data, ensuring quick retrieval and persistence.

### Front-End
- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable components.
- **Redux:** Manages the application's state, making it easier to handle data flow and state management across the app.
- **Formik:** Simplifies form handling in React, offering built-in validation and submission handling.
- **Google Authentication:** Adds an additional layer of security and convenience, allowing users to log in using their Google accounts. 
- **Material-UI (MUI) & Tailwind CSS:** Combines MUI's component-based styling with Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework to create a visually appealing and responsive design.
